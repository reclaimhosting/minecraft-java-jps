# Minecraft Java Server for Reclaim Cloud
In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools, build structures or earthworks, and depending on game mode, can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Minecraft servers allow players to play online or via a local area network with other people. This installs the Java variant of Minecraft server. For information on compatibility see [https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition)

Our implementation of Minecraft Java Server uses Docker and you can customize a variety of settings through the use of environment variables. For a full list of documented options visit [https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/blob/master/README.md). To add variables to your container, after install you will click the gear icon and select Variables where you can add your own settings in key/value format.
